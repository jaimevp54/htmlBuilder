Welcome to htmlBuilder's documentation
***************************************

HtmlBuilder is a python library that allows you to render HTML files by writing python code. And to make use of python features, clean syntax, and object-oriented design to their full potential.   

Why should you care about this library?
***************************************

When rendering HTML programmatically, there are other options available (template engines and other rendering libraries). Still, these are often limited in what they can do, or it's necessary to learn a new level of abstraction before being productive. HtmlBuilder tries to improve on this by following the next few ideas: 

- **Minimal learning curve**: Users should need no more than  Python and HTML knowledge to be productive using this tool.
- **Real python code**: The final code looks and behaves as you would expect from other python code.
- **Easily testable**: Users can introspect and unit test the HTML object structure **before** rendering the HTML string.
